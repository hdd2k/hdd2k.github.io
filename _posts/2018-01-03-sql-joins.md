title:  "SQL joins"
---

I was getting a little bored reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications] so I did some SQL practice with [pgexercises](https://pgexercises.com)

It's just a practice site with artifical examples - it deals superficially with a bunch of basic concepts but I thought I'd just talk about joins

This is a simple rehashing of information learned from the following websites,

 - [SQL joins Explained](http://www.sql-join.com/)
 - [Coding Horror blog entry --- visual SQL joins](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/)

I'll be writing about the following

  - Keys
  - What is a join
  - Types of joins

## Keys

A key basically is 1 or more *columns* in a Relational Database that is/are **unique** across rows

The key is helpful in putting together ("joining") various relations ("tables") together for querying

In a future post, I will cover what keys are personally, but there is another resource that is pretty good [What are keys?](https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-01-01-sql-keys-in-depth.html#what-are-keys-really)

## What is a join

When various different relations ("tables") have rows and rows of information, it is helpful to be able to put together the information scattered across many "tables"

For instance, if there are 2 tables (Customers) and (Orders) then we would likely want to be able to join info on these 2 tables based on customer_id's on both tables

If we were to draw a Venn Diagram with each circle being a whole "table," then the **intersection** is defined by what we choose as **key** to join on

And after we have chosen the key on which to join 2 tables, we can use various **types of joins** to retrieve parts of the Venn Diagram we want


## Types of joins

To go in further detail we would have to talk more about sets, but I will do that in later posts

- inner join : intersection of the 2 tables (based on key) --- set (!) of records / rows that match for BOTH tables!!

- full outer join : union of the 2 tables --- set (!) of records / rows from BOTH tables!!

- left join (~left outer join) : ALL of left table (with matching records from right table if available or NULL) --- set (!) complete with left table with info from right table when available

- right join (~right outer join) : Same as left join, except on the right

- cross join : Cartesian product... basically all possible combinations left x right tables (very expensive op with large tables)
